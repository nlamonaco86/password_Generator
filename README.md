## User Story 

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Technologies
This password generator uses jQuery and Bootstrap for styling. I themed it like The Matrix since that's probably my favorite movie.
